Every Three Numbers
Letâ€™s start our challenging problems with a function that creates a list of numbers up to 100 in increments of 3 
starting from a number that is passed to the function as an input parameter. 

Here is what we need to do:

1.Define the function to accept one parameter for our starting number
2.Calculate the numbers between the starting number and 100 while incrementing by 3
3.Store the numbers in a list
4.Return the list
