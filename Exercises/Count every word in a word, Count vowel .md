Create a function that takes one parameter that is string, and prints the 'vowel count' and returns dictionary of every word as key, and its count as value.
But space is not counted.

For example,

```py
every_word_count("hello from the other side")
```

would return

```
Vowel count : 8
{'h': 3,
 'e': 4,
 'l': 2,
 'o': 3,
 'f': 1,
 'r': 2,
 'm': 1,
 't': 2,
 's': 1,
 'i': 1,
 'd': 1}
```
