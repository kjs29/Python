Every Three Numbers
Letâ€™s start our challenging problems with a function that creates a list of numbers up to 100 in increments of 3 
starting from a number that is passed to the function as an input parameter. 

Here is what we need to do:

1.Define the function to accept one parameter for our starting number
2.Calculate the numbers between the starting number and 100 while incrementing by 3
3.Store the numbers in a list
4.Return the list
```

  ```py

  def increase_by_three(starting_number):
      lst = []

      while starting_number<=100:
          lst.append(starting_number)
          starting_number += 3
      return lst
  
  print(increase_by_three(88))        #[88, 91, 94, 97, 100]
  
  ```
