## 1.1 Saving the game data as JSON file
let's say we have a dictionary called `level_system`.

```py
level_system = {"tries" : 0,
                "n1_exp" : n1_exp,
                "n2_exp" : n2_exp,
                "n3_exp" : n3_exp,
                "n4_exp" : n4_exp,
                "n5_exp" : n5_exp,
                "n6_exp" : n6_exp,
                "n7_exp" : n7_exp,
                "n8_exp" : n8_exp,
                "n9_exp" : n9_exp,
                }
```

And we want to save this file as json file

```py
level_system = {"tries" : 0,
                "n1_exp" : n1_exp,
                "n2_exp" : n2_exp,
                "n3_exp" : n3_exp,
                "n4_exp" : n4_exp,
                "n5_exp" : n5_exp,
                "n6_exp" : n6_exp,
                "n7_exp" : n7_exp,
                "n8_exp" : n8_exp,
                "n9_exp" : n9_exp,
                }
while run:

    --- snip ---
    # modifying the level_system while user is playing the game
    if (something happens):
        (tries goes up by 1)
        (n9_exp goes up by 1)
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
```

when we look at the <em>level.txt</em>

```py
{"tries": 1, "n1_exp": 0, "n2_exp": 0, "n3_exp": 0, "n4_exp": 0, "n5_exp": 0, "n6_exp": 0, "n7_exp": 0, "n8_exp": 0, "n9_exp": 1}
```

we can tell that 'tries has gone up by 1' and 'n9_exp' has gone up by 1 as well

## 1.2 Now we exit the game and we run the game again, we should be able to load the data back again.

```py
level_system = {"tries" : 0,
                "n1_exp" : n1_exp,
                "n2_exp" : n2_exp,
                "n3_exp" : n3_exp,
                "n4_exp" : n4_exp,
                "n5_exp" : n5_exp,
                "n6_exp" : n6_exp,
                "n7_exp" : n7_exp,
                "n8_exp" : n8_exp,
                "n9_exp" : n9_exp,
                }
try:
    with open("level.txt") as levelfile:
        level_system = json.load(levelfile)
except:
    pass
    
while run:
    --- snip ---
    # modifying the level_system while user is playing the game
    if (something happens):
        (tries goes up by 1)
        (n9_exp goes up by 1)
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
```

The reason why I put `try, except` is that this will create error if the `level.txt` file doesn't exist in the folder.

The file doesn't exist on the first time we play the game.

<em>The first time I create a json file is here, which is after I finish playing the game.</em>
```py
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
```

Now, since I wrote this code below, I can now load the json file back when I run the game again.
```py
try:
    with open("level.txt") as levelfile:
        level_system = json.load(levelfile)
except:
    pass
```

## 2. Make the file invisible

We don't want users to cheat on the games so I decided to hide the `level.txt` file so that they can't modify it.

This can be achieved by this code.
```py
# Make the level.txt file invisible
os.system("attrib +h level.txt")   
```

So we want this code to come right after we dump the json file

Just like this.
```py
while run:
    --- snip ---
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
    
    # Make the file invisible
    os.system("attrib +h level.txt")  
```

But I realized that the game won't be able to read the file once it is invisible,

So we need to make it visible right before we dump the json file so that the game can successfully write it.
```py
while run:
    --- snip ---
    # Make the file visible again
    os.system("attrib -h level.txt")  
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
    
    # Make the file invisible
    os.system("attrib +h level.txt")  
```
