## 1.1 Saving the game data as JSON file
let's say we have a dictionary called `level_system`.

```py
level_system = {"tries" : 0,
                "n1_exp" : n1_exp,
                "n2_exp" : n2_exp,
                "n3_exp" : n3_exp,
                "n4_exp" : n4_exp,
                "n5_exp" : n5_exp,
                "n6_exp" : n6_exp,
                "n7_exp" : n7_exp,
                "n8_exp" : n8_exp,
                "n9_exp" : n9_exp,
                }
```

And we want to save this file as json file

```py
level_system = {"tries" : 0,
                "n1_exp" : n1_exp,
                "n2_exp" : n2_exp,
                "n3_exp" : n3_exp,
                "n4_exp" : n4_exp,
                "n5_exp" : n5_exp,
                "n6_exp" : n6_exp,
                "n7_exp" : n7_exp,
                "n8_exp" : n8_exp,
                "n9_exp" : n9_exp,
                }
while run:

    --- snip ---
    # modifying the level_system while user is playing the game
    if (something happens):
        (tries goes up by 1)
        (n9_exp goes up by 1)
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
```

when we look at the <em>level.txt</em>

```py
{"tries": 1, "n1_exp": 0, "n2_exp": 0, "n3_exp": 0, "n4_exp": 0, "n5_exp": 0, "n6_exp": 0, "n7_exp": 0, "n8_exp": 0, "n9_exp": 1}
```

we can tell that 'tries has gone up by 1' and 'n9_exp' has gone up by 1 as well

## 1.2 Now we exit the game and we run the game again, we should be able to load the data back again.

```py
level_system = {"tries" : 0,
                "n1_exp" : n1_exp,
                "n2_exp" : n2_exp,
                "n3_exp" : n3_exp,
                "n4_exp" : n4_exp,
                "n5_exp" : n5_exp,
                "n6_exp" : n6_exp,
                "n7_exp" : n7_exp,
                "n8_exp" : n8_exp,
                "n9_exp" : n9_exp,
                }
try:
    with open("level.txt") as levelfile:
        level_system = json.load(levelfile)
except:
    pass
    
while run:
    --- snip ---
    # modifying the level_system while user is playing the game
    if (something happens):
        (tries goes up by 1)
        (n9_exp goes up by 1)
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
```

The reason why I put `try, except` is that this will create error if the `level.txt` file doesn't exist in the folder.

The file doesn't exist on the first time we play the game.

<em>The first time I create a json file is here, which is after I finish playing the game.</em>
```py
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
```

Now, since I wrote this code below, I can now load the json file back when I run the game again.
```py
try:
    with open("level.txt") as levelfile:
        level_system = json.load(levelfile)
except:
    pass
```

## 2. Make the file invisible

We don't want users to cheat on the games so I decided to hide the `level.txt` file so that they can't modify it.

<em>Making the file invisible</em>
```py
import os
--- snip ---

# Make the level.txt file invisible
os.system("attrib +h level.txt")   
```

So we want this code to come right after we dump the json file

Just like this.
```py
while run:
    --- snip ---
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
    
    # Make the file invisible
    os.system("attrib +h level.txt")  
```

But I realized that the game won't be able to read the file once it is invisible,

So we need to make it visible right before we dump the json file so that the game can successfully write it.
```py

while run:
    --- snip ---
    # Make the file visible again
    os.system("attrib -h level.txt")  
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
    
    # Make the file invisible
    os.system("attrib +h level.txt")  
```

## But now I decided to make the file uneditable just to be sure that people won't cheat.

<em>Making the file uneditable</em>
```py
# Make the file uneditable - aka read only mode
os.chmod("level.txt",S_IREAD)
```

We want to put the code line right after we dump the file so that people can't modify the file.

```py
from stat import S_IREAD, S_IRGRP, S_IROTH, S_IRWXU

--- snip ---

while run:
    --- snip ---
    # Make the file visible again
    os.system("attrib -h level.txt")  
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
    
    # Make the file invisible
    os.system("attrib +h level.txt")  
    
    # Make the file uneditable - aka read only mode
    os.chmod("level.txt",S_IREAD)
```

But the problem is when we play the game again, the file is still in 'uneditable mode', the program now can't access to the file.

So we have to make the file editable again.

<em>To make the file editable</em>
```py
# Make the file editable again
if os.path.isfile("level.txt"):
    os.chmod("level.txt", S_IRWXU|S_IREAD)
```
And this code `if os.path.isfile("level.txt"):` means that if `level.txt` exists it shows `True` otherwise `False`

We have to put this line of code here
```py
from stat import S_IREAD, S_IRGRP, S_IROTH, S_IRWXU

--- snip ---

while run:
    --- snip ---
    # Make the file visible again
    os.system("attrib -h level.txt")
    
    # Make the file editable again
    if os.path.isfile("level.txt"):
        os.chmod("level.txt", S_IRWXU|S_IREAD)
    
    # save the data into the textfile
    with open("level.txt","w") as levelfile:
        json.dump(level_system, levelfile)
    
    # Make the file invisible
    os.system("attrib +h level.txt")  
    
    # Make the file uneditable
    os.chmod("level.txt",S_IREAD)
```

Basically what we are doing is,

1. Make the file visible
2. Make the file editable if the file exists
3. Modify the file
4. Make the file invisible
5. Make the file uneditable
