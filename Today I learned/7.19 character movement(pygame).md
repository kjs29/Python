There used to be some stiff movement for the player in pygame

I used this code
```py


# ---snip---
playerX = 550
playerY = 360
run = True
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                playerX_change = -5
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                playerX_change = 5
        if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT or event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                playerX_change = 0
    playerX += playerX_change
```

but this used to have some stiff movement.

So this code works with smoother movement
```py
# --- snip---
playerX = 550
playerY = 360
player_speed = 10
heldkeys = []
run = True
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                heldkeys.append("left")
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                heldkeys.append("right")
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                heldkeys.append("up")
            if event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                heldkeys.append("down")
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                heldkeys.remove("left")
            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                heldkeys.remove("right")
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                heldkeys.remove("up")
            if event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                heldkeys.remove("down")
    for each in heldkeys:
        if "left" in heldkeys:
            playerX -= player_speed
        if "right" in heldkeys:
            playerX += player_speed    
        if "up" in heldkeys:
            playerY -= player_speed
        if "down" in heldkeys:
            playerY += player_speed  
            
```
I am sure there are some other ways to implement smooth playermovement, but so far I think I am satisfied with this.



# This is a good way to implement smooth key movement (edited on 7/28)
```py
playerX = 550
playerY = 360
player_speed = 10
run = True
while run:
    keys = pygame.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
        playerY -= player_speed
    if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
        playerY += player_speed
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
        playerX -= player_speed
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
        playerX += player_speed
```
