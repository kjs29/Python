# Opening files in Python Editor

### Let's say we have file called 'stocks to trade.txt'
<em>stocks to trade.txt</em>
```
6/11
NFLX
GPRO
```

If we hava a python file open in the same directory as 'stocks to trade.txt',
we can write like this to open the 'stocks to trade.txt' file.

```py
with open("stocks to trade.txt") as stt:
    stocks_to_trade = stt.read()
print(stocks_to_trade)
```
And we get

```
6/11
NFLX
GPRO

```

But notice that we have one more empty line at the end, if we want to remove the empty line, use `rstrip()`
```
print(stocks_to_trade.rstrip())
```
And we get
```
6/11
NFLX
GPRO
```

# What if the file we want to bring is stored in different directory?

- ## if the file is in different folder that is inside of the current python's directory (Relative file path)

For example, the current python file is stored in `C:\Desktop\Coding\Python`

And the file (`stocks to trade.txt`) we want to open is stored in `C:\Desktop\Coding\Python\git_practice`

we can use
```py
with open("git_practice/stocks to trade.txt") as stt:     #notice that even in windows that uses backslash, we use slash '/', because backslash is used to escape.
```
- ## if the file is totally in different directory (Absolute file path)

For example, the file(`stocks to trade.txt`) is stored in `C:\Desktop\stocks`

we can use
```py
file_path = "C:/Desktop/stocks/stocks to trade.txt"
with open(file_path) as stt:
    stocks_to_trade = stt.read()
print(stocks_to_trade.rstrip())
```
