# sorting a dictionary

Let's consider the following example.

```py
coins = {
    "btc": 65000,
    "sol": 145,
    "xrp":0.60
}
```

We must know that dictionary does not have a built-in sorting method.

Because dictionary keys are not accessible by a numerical index, so it does not have an index and is not iterable.

However, there is a way to sort the dictionary using `.items()` and `sorted()` methods.

```py
coins = {
    "btc": 65000,
    "sol": 145,
    "xrp":0.60
}

coins_sorted = dict(sorted(coins.items()))  # sort

print(coins_sorted) # {'btc': 65000, 'sol': 145, 'xrp': 0.6}
```

What happens here is that `coins.items()` converts a dictionary into a list of tuple pair `(key, value)`, then `sorted()` sorts the list.

We can see that the `coins_sorted` prints `{'btc': 65000, 'sol': 145, 'xrp': 0.6}`.

<em>In python 3.7+, dictionary preserves the order in which entries are inserted, allowing FIFO(first-in, first-out)

when we use iteration with `.keys()`, `.values()`, or `.items()`</em>[^1].

```py
alphabets = {}
alphabets['c'] = 3
alphabets['b'] = 2
alphabets['a'] = 1

for k,v in alphabets.items():
    print(k,v)

# c 3
# b 2
# a 1


for k,v in reversed(alphabets.items()):
    print(k,v)

# a 1
# b 2
# c 3
```

Knowing this, we can see that sorted dictionary does NOT change the actual index, because it is not iterable anyway,

but changes the order of insertion.

This would be useful in some situation where we need dictionary and queue feature.

```py
# To preserve the order of inserted or deleted items in the dictionary
from collections import OrderedDict

od = OrderedDict()
od['a'] = 1
od['b'] = 2
od['c'] = 3

print(od.items())       # [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

od.popitem(last=False)  # pop the first inserted item, works like queue

print(od.items())       # odict_items([('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
```
