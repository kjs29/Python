Correlation
-

- Correlation is a measure of how closely two datasets are associated with each other.
- It is a common tool for describing simple relationships without making a statement about cause and effect.
- Positive correlation indicates that the two assets tend to act similary
- Negative correlation indicates that the two assets tend to act oppositely
- No correlation indicates that two assets have no relationship, where correlation coefficient is close to 0
- It doesn't explain what asset causes the other asset or vice versea, if the association is caused by the third factor.
- Two assets being correlated does not imply causation.
- 

What is a correlation coefficient?
-
- Correlation is represented by a correlation coefficient.
- It is on a scale of -1 to 1. (-1 perfectly negatively correlated, +1 perfectly positively correlated, 0 no correlated)
- How to calculate
```
import math
x = [41,19,23,40,55,57,33]
y = [94,60,74,71,82,76,61]
print(x*2)

def correlated(x,y):
    sum_x = sum(x)
    sum_y = sum(y)
    sum_xy = sum([x*y for x,y in zip(x,y)])
    sum_x2 = sum([a**2 for a in x])
    sum_y2 = sum([b**2 for b in y])
    n = len(x)
    up = n * sum_xy - sum_x * sum_y
    down = math.sqrt((n*sum_x2-sum_x**2)*(n*sum_y2-sum_y**2))
    
    return up/down
    

print(correlated(x,y))        #0.5398442342154088

# numpy
numpy = numerical python
we can use numpy by 
```
import numpy as np 
```

To create a Numpy array of numerical values,
in fact, it doens't have to be numbers, each element can be strings, or other arrays

- Numpy array is a powerful data structure
```
variable_test1 = np.array([92,92,88,99,84])
variable_test2 = np.array(["AAPL","NFLX","MSFT","GOOG","FB"])
print(variable_test1)           #[92 92 88 99 84]
print(variable_test2)           #['AAPL' 'NFLX' 'MSFT' 'GOOG' 'FB']
```

To import arrays from csv,

```
variable_test3 = np.genfromtxt("SPY.csv",delimiter = ',')
print(variable_test3)
```

Operations with numpy array
-
if we want to add 3 in each element in an array
```

arr = [92,92,88,99,84]
arr3 = []
for a in range(len(arr)):
    arr3.append(arr[a] + 3)

print(arr3)

```

But with numpy array we can write simply like this
```
arr3_easy = np.array(arr) + 3
print(arr3_easy)
```
we can also find squares, or squareroot using this
```
arr_sqr = np.array(arr) ** 2
print(arr_sqr)             #[8464 8464 7744 9801 7056]
arr_sqrt = np.sqrt(np.array(arr)) 
print(arr_sqrt)            #[9.59166305 9.59166305 9.38083152 9.94987437 9.16515139]
```
