Correlation
-

- Correlation is a measure of how closely two datasets are associated with each other.
- It is a common tool for describing simple relationships without making a statement about cause and effect.
- Positive correlation indicates that the two assets tend to act similary
- Negative correlation indicates that the two assets tend to act oppositely
- No correlation indicates that two assets have no relationship, where correlation coefficient is close to 0
- It doesn't explain what asset causes the other asset or vice versea, if the association is caused by the third factor.
- Two assets being correlated does not imply causation.
- 

What is a correlation coefficient?
-
- Correlation is represented by a correlation coefficient.
- It is on a scale of -1 to 1. (-1 perfectly negatively correlated, +1 perfectly positively correlated, 0 no correlated)
- How to calculate
```
import math
x = [41,19,23,40,55,57,33]
y = [94,60,74,71,82,76,61]
print(x*2)

def correlated(x,y):
    sum_x = sum(x)
    sum_y = sum(y)
    sum_xy = sum([x*y for x,y in zip(x,y)])
    sum_x2 = sum([a**2 for a in x])
    sum_y2 = sum([b**2 for b in y])
    n = len(x)
    up = n * sum_xy - sum_x * sum_y
    down = math.sqrt((n*sum_x2-sum_x**2)*(n*sum_y2-sum_y**2))
    
    return up/down
    

print(correlated(x,y))        #0.5398442342154088
