Simple Return
-simple return - calculating multiple assets

-simple return = (ending price - starting price)/starting price

Logarithmic Return
-logarithmic return - for calculating one single asset

-log return = log(ending price) - log(starting price) = log(ending price / starting price)
```


What is LOG?

We have 5000 dollars, and we know this one strategy's annual return is 10%
How many years does it take for our initial 5000 to become 25000?

5000 * 1.1<sup>x</sup> = 25000

1.1<sup>x</sup> = 5

x = log<sub>1.1</sub>5

We read like
"x is equal to log of 5, base of 1.1"

if we want to create function in python
it would look like

```
import math

howmanyyears = math.log(5, 1.1) 
print(howmanyyears)       #16.886317030755073
```
