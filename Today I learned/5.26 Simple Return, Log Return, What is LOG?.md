Simple Return
-simple return - calculating multiple assets

-simple return = (ending price - starting price)/starting price

Logarithmic Return
-logarithmic return - for calculating one single asset

-log return = log(ending price) - log(starting price) = log(ending price / starting price)
```


What is LOG?

We have 5000 dollars, and we know this one strategy's annual return is 10%
How many years does it take for our initial 5000 to become 25000?

5000 * 1.1<sup>x</sup> = 25000

1.1<sup>x</sup> = 5

x = log<sub>1.1</sub>5

We read like
"x is equal to log of 5, base of 1.1"

if we want to create function in python
it would look like

```
import math

howmanyyears = math.log(5, 1.1) 
print(howmanyyears)       #16.886317030755073
```

The Difference between Simple Return and Log Return
Log Returns are additive over time.
Simple Returns are not addictive over time.

For example,
If we have initial capital of $5000,

If Simple Daily return is 1%, and in an year, the capital will be 5000 * 1.01<sup>252</sup> = $61370 (252 is # of trading days in an year) 

Annual return will be (61370 - 5000) / 5000 * 100 =  1,127% (11 times original capital)

If Log Daily return is 1%, and in an year, the capital will be 5000 + (0.01 * 252 * 5000) = 5000 + 12600 = $17600

Annual return will be 0.01 * 252 * 100 = 252% (2.52 times original capital)
