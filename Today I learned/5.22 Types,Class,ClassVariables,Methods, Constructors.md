1.
# Types
# Class
# Class Variables
# Methods with only 'self'
# Methods with multi arguments including 'self'
# Constructors

---
# to know what type of data some variables are... use type()

```
a = 29
type(a)
```

# Class

```
#use capital letter for the name of class
class Cool_people:
  pass                  #to avoid indent problem, we just wrote pass
```

# Instantiation, it's like calling function, but it calls class
We need `object`, which is like variable.


```
cool_people_object = Cool_people()
```
# Class Variables

```
class Class_name:
  
  #here goes class_variable_name and a data type
  class_variable_name = anydata

object_name = Class_name()
```

# To access Class Variable the syntax is as below:

```
print(object_name.class_variable_name)
```

# Methods are the functions defined as part of a class

```py
class Stocks:
  stockname = "AAPL"
  
  #hello() is a method
  def hello(self):                        #notice that there is a 'self' as an argument
    print("hello this stock's ticker is {}.".format(self.stockname))
```

# Instantiation
```
class Stocks:
  stockname = "AAPL"
  
  #hello() is a method
  def hello(self):                        #notice that there is a 'self' as an argument
    print("hello this stock's ticker is {}.".format(self.stockname))

#Instantiation
first_stock = Stocks()

first_stock.hello()                       #hello this stock's ticker is AAPL.
```

# Creating methods that have multi arguments in some class

```
class Circle:
  pi = 3.14
  
  #we are taking two arguments 'self' , and 'radius'
  def area(self, radius):
    return self.pi * radius ** 2                    #pi*r^2 is area of a circle
  
circle = Circle()
kitchen_table = circle.area(5)                      #78.5
```

---
# Constructors : Methods that are used to prepare an object being instantiated/ Constructors are used to initialized the data
# usually in python constructors refer to __init__

```
class Plane:
  def __init__(self, company, model, seats):            #__init__ is a constructor or a method(that takes instances)
    self.company = company
    self.model = model
    self.seats = seats
  def wiki(self):
    print("The {} {} has {} seats".format(self.company, self.model, self.seats))
    
p = Plane("Boeing", "737", 140)
p.wiki()                            #The Boeing 737 has 140 seats
```

---another example of class
```
class Robot:
  
    def __init__(self, givenName, givenColor, givenWeight):
        self.name = givenName
        self.color = givenColor
        self.weight = givenWeight
        
    def introduce_self(self):
        print("My name is " + self.name)
        
        
r1 = Robot("Tom", "red", 30)
r2 = Robot("Jerry", "blue", 40)
"""
self.name = "Tom"
self.color = "blue"
self.weight = 30
"""
r1.introduce_self()                                 #My name is Tom
```
