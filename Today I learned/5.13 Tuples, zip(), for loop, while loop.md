---Tuples
```py
#Creating a Tuple
stocks = ("AAPL", 147, "Technology")

#unpacking a tuple
ticker, price, sector = stocks
print(stocks)             #('AAPL', 147, 'Technology')
print(ticker)             #AAPL
print(price)              #147
print(sector)             #Technology

#creating 1 element tuple
one_tuple = (4)       #but this will NOT create a tuple
print(one_tuple)      #4
one_tuple_real = (4,)
print(one_tuple_real) #(4,)
```

zip()

```py
#zip() is used to combine two lists together
tickersofstocks = ["AAPL","KO","GPRO"]
namesofstocks = ["APPLE","COCA-COLA","GOPRO"]
stockstotrade = zip(tickersofstocks,namesofstocks)              #<zip object at 0x00000283F0B9BE80>
#use list() to show list
stockstotrade = list(stockstotrade)                             #reassign the list of stockstotrade to stockstotrade
print(stockstotrade)                                            #[('AAPL', 'APPLE'), ('KO', 'COCA-COLA'), ('GPRO', 'GOPRO')] but this is in tuples
```

---for loop
"""
basic syntax for for loop

for <temporary variable> in <collection>:
  <action>

"""

#temporary variable is arbitrary, which doesn't need to be defined

stocks = ["AAPL", "KO", "PEP", "GPRO", "KORU", "BABA"]

#if we want to name all elements in a list 'stocks'
for name in stocks:
  print(name)                                   

"""
result:
KO
PEP
GPRO
KORU
BABA
"""

#print the same sentence 5 times using for loops
for temp in range(5):
  print("I will create an amazing product.")

for temp in range(5):
#if I want to see what iteration we are on
  print("I will create an amazing product." + str(temp))
  
---while loop
#while loop
"""
Basic syntax for while loop is this

while <conditional statement>:
  <action>

"""

#if we want to write countdown from 10 to 0 using while loop
countdown = 10
while countdown >= 0:
  print(countdown)
  countdown -= 1
  
#if we want to list each elements in a list using while loop
stocks = ["AAPL", "KO", "PEP", "GPRO", "KORU", "BABA"]
count = 0
while count < len(stocks):
  print(stocks[count])
  count += 1
  
---example of finding certain element, example of break

stocks = ["AAPL", "KO", "PEP", "GPRO", "KORU", "BABA"]

#if we want to see if GPRO exists in a stocks list
for i in stocks:
  if i == "GPRO":
    print(i+ " exists")
    #if we want to break out of the loop we can use break statement, this can be used when we have lots of elements in a list
    break

---example of continue
stockstotrade = ["AAPL","KORU","NFLX","KO"]
#check if stockstotrade list has NFLX and skip it
for skip in stockstotrade:
    if skip == "NFLX":
        continue
    print(skip)
