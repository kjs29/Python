# count()
```py
text = "Hello there, the school I attended was Harvard, but the grades were not so good"

#This prints how many times the content has 'the '
#The reason why it has space after the is it would also count words like 'there'
print(text.lower().count("the "))       #2
```

# read(), split()

let's say that we have a file 

<em>guest.txt</em>
```
JosÃ© Mourinho
```
# if we want to count how many words there are in the file, we can use

#### read(), split(), len()

1. `read()` method converts the file into a string                  // File -> String

2. `split()` method converts a string into a list of string divided by the " "(space)             // String -> List

3. `len()` method then counts how many words there are in the list that `split()` method created. 
```py
try:
    with open("C:/Users/daily/Desktop/Coding/Python/git_practice/guest.txt") as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass
else:
    #print(content)
    #print(type(content))
    print(len(content.split()))
```
# if we want to count how many letters there are in the file, excluding the whitespace " "

## first of all, let's remind ourselves.

1.
```py
text = "Hello"
print(len(text))          #5
```
2.
```py
text = "Hello world"
print(text.split())           #['Hello','world']
print(len(text.split()))         #2
```
3.
```py
random_list = ["hello", "world"]
print("".join(random_list))         #helloworld
```
---

```py
try:
    with open("C:/Users/daily/Desktop/Coding/Python/git_practice/guest.txt") as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass
else:
    #this converts string into a list of strings
    a = content.split()
    
    #Now we want to put it all back together
    b = "".join(a)
    
    #Now count the string
    print(len(b))
```
Or there is another way of achieving this.

```py
try:
    with open("C:/Users/daily/Desktop/Coding/Python/git_practice/dogs.txt") as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass
else:
    #count how many letters there are in a content including whitespace and the newline
    a = len(content)
    
    #count how many spaces there are in a content
    b = content.count(" ")
    
    #count how many newlines there are in a content
    c = content.count("\n")

    print(a - b - c)
```
