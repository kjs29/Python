# Opening files in Python Editor

### Let's say we have file called 'stocks to trade.txt'
<em>stocks to trade.txt</em>
```
6/11
NFLX
GPRO
```

If we hava a python file open in the same directory as 'stocks to trade.txt',
we can write like this to open the 'stocks to trade.txt' file.

```py
with open("stocks to trade.txt") as stt:
    stocks_to_trade = stt.read()
print(stocks_to_trade)
```
And we get

```
6/11
NFLX
GPRO

```
`read()` reads the whole file.

But notice that we have one more empty line at the end, if we want to remove the empty line, use `rstrip()`
```
print(stocks_to_trade.rstrip())
```
And we get
```
6/11
NFLX
GPRO
```

# What if the file we want to bring is stored in different directory?

- ## if the file is in different folder that is inside of the current python's directory (Relative file path)

For example, the current python file is stored in `C:\Desktop\Coding\Python`

And the file (`stocks to trade.txt`) we want to open is stored in `C:\Desktop\Coding\Python\git_practice`

we can use
```py
with open("git_practice/stocks to trade.txt") as stt:     #notice that even in windows that uses backslash, we use slash '/', because backslash is used to escape.
```
- ## if the file is totally in different directory (Absolute file path)

For example, the file(`stocks to trade.txt`) is stored in `C:\Desktop\stocks`

we can use
```py
file_path = "C:/Desktop/stocks/stocks to trade.txt"
with open(file_path) as stt:
    stocks_to_trade = stt.read()
print(stocks_to_trade.rstrip())
```

# If we want to print each line

```py
with open("stocks to trade.txt") as stt:
    for line in stt:
        print(line)
```

# If we want to store each line in a list 
`readlines()`
```py
with open("stocks to trade.txt") as stt:
    random_var = stt.readlines()
print(random_var)
```

# let's say we have a file

<em>pi_digits.txt</em>

```
3.1415926535 
  8979323846 
  2643383279

```
And we want to check how many decimal places it has.

we would write,
```py
with open("C:/Desktop/Coding/Python/git_practice/pi_digits.txt") as pi:
    
    #this line means that it stores as a list of strings. Each line becomes an element.
    pi_file = pi.readlines()

#we make this empty string for later use
random_string = ""

for line in pi_file:
    random_string += line.strip()           #add each element in list 'pi_file' to random string, but each line has no whitespaces around
print(random_string)                        #3.141592653589793238462643383279
print(len(random_string))                   #32, this means it has 30 digits
```

# Any file Python reads converts into strings. If we want to use numerical value, we have to use
`float()` or `int()`

```py
import decimal
with open("C:/Desktop/Coding/Python/git_practice/pi_digits.txt") as pi:
    
    #this line means that it stores as a list of strings. Each line becomes an element.
    pi_file = pi.readlines()

#we make this empty string for later use
random_string = ""

for line in pi_file:
    random_string += line.strip()           #add each element in list 'pi_file' to random string, but each line has no whitespaces around

#we want to store as decimals
real_number_pi = decimal.Decimal(random_string)


print(real_number_pi)                       #3.141592653589793238462643383279
print(type(real_number_pi))                 #<class 'decimal.Decimal'>
print(real_number_pi + 3)                   #6.141592653589793238462643383279
```
