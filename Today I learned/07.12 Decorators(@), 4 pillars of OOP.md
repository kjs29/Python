# Decorators

# Encapsulation

# Abstraction

# Inheritance

# Polymorphism



<em>My first decorators code</em>

```py
def decorating_function(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("A great software engineer")
        func()
    return wrapper

@decorating_function
def function_to_be_decorated():
    print("hello, my name is Jin!")

function_to_be_decorated()
```
```
A great software engineer
hello, my name is Jin!
```

`@decorating_function` is the decorator.

Decorators exist to add some more functionality to existing functions, but programmers don't want to modify functions because they also need those functions.
