# Polymorphism

Normally when we create a function, there is only one functionality.

```py
def say_hello():
    print("hello")

say_hello()   #hello
say_hello()   #hello
say_hello()   #hello
```
In this case above, this `say_hello()` function has only one functionality : `print("hello")`

But Polymorphism allows same named function to create different outputs by having different functionalities.
```py
class Person:
    def say_hello(self):
        print("hello")
        
class Korean(Person):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("안녕하세요?")

class Indian(Person):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("ਸਤ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ")

p1 = Person()
p2 = Korean()
p3 = Indian()

party = [p1, p2, p3]
for each_person in party:
    each_person.say_hello()
```

<em>Output</em>
```
hello
안녕하세요?
ਸਤ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ
```

The same named function `say_hello()` has different outputs.
