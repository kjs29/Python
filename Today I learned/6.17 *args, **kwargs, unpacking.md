## *args , **kwargs

#### *args = arbitrary arguments
#### **kwargs = arbitrary keyword arguments 

When we make functions, we take arguments like this

```py
def addition(number1, number2):
    result = number1 + number2
    return result
```

### What if we want to add as many arguments as possible?

Then we can use *args.

<em>Example 1</em>

```py
def addition_multiple_numbers(*numbers):
    result = 0
    for number in numbers:
        result += number
    return result
```
<em>and we get...</em>
```py
addition_multiple_numbers(1,2,3,4,5)                #15
```

In this example 1 we used <strong><em>*numbers</em></strong> instead of <strong><em>*args</em></strong>

it works like a regular argument except that there is an asterisk in front of the parameter.

So `*args` is used to take as many arguments as we want in a function.

If we want to see how *args works, we can print *args in a function

```py
def addition_multiple_numbers(*numbers):
    
    #we inserted this line
    print(numbers)
    result = 0
    for number in numbers:
        result += number
    return result
```
```py
addition_multiple_numbers(1,2,3,4,5)
```
<em>and we get...</em>
```py
(1,2,3,4,5)
15
```
we can see that *numbers are stored in a tuple

As we can see in the <em>Example 1</em>, we can loop through the tuple, and let each element to add each other

```py
a = (1,2,3,4,5)
total = 0
for each in a:
    total += each
print(total)
```
```py
15
```

### **kwargs

Now let's take a look at **kwargs.

let's say we are creating a grocery items tracking app

we want to save each item in a dictionary

```py
def grocery_items(**items):
    print(items)

grocery_items(bread=2,banana = 2, rice_40kg = 1, water = 20)
```
<em>and we get</em>
```py
{'bread': 2, 'banana': 2, 'rice_40kg': 1, 'water': 20}
```
we can see that **kwargs are stored in a dictionary

# other ways to use *
## unpacking
```py
lst1 = [1,2,3]
def addition(a,b,c):
    return a+b+c

#call addition function
addition(*lst1)
```
<em>We get the result...</em>
```py
6
```
