# Unpacking tuples

```py
def save_firstname_lastname(fullname):
    return fullname.split()[0], fullname.split()[1]

print(save_firstname_lastname("John Conor"))  # ('John', 'Conor')
```

We can see that this funciton returned a tuple. We can unpack this tuple.

```py
human1_firstname, human1_lastname = save_firstname_lastname("John Conor")

print(human1_firstname)
print(human1_lastname)
```

Another example of unpacking

```py
lst_of_info = [(180,"S"), (164,"Q"), (175,"J")]

for height,initial in lst_of_info:
    print(f"height : {height}, initial : {initial}")
```
