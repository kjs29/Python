# input()

For some reason, ```input()``` seemed difficult for me to understand so I tried to understand what ```input()``` is.

Basic input() function takes no prompt like this.

We can just write

```
print(input())
```

But this does not do anything.


And most cases, we want to save what the user writes as some variable.
**BECAUSE it becomes useful data**


# How to save input as variable
```
a = input() 
print(a)

>hello I will become a creative and unique programmer!
```

This means now 

```a``` is ```hello I will become a creative and unique programmer!!```

# we can also write some message and get input data from the user

```
b = input("When will you become a software engineer? \n")
print(b)
```

```
When will you become a software engineer? 
> In one year
```

Now ```b``` is ```In one year```

---
**Any input we get from the user is set to ```string```**

To find out,
```

#we want to ask the user "Enter any number" and get number from the user
c = input("Enter any number : ")

print(type(c))
```

```
Enter any number : 15
<class 'str'>
```

We can see that even though it is number it is a string type.

# If we want to take integer as input
```
d = int(input("Enter any number : "))
```

# If we want to take multiple inputs in one line
```
name, age, dream = input("Enter your name, age, and money (separated by space) : ").split()

print(name, age, dream)
```
This will result
```
Enter your name, age, and money (separated by space) : Jin 29 0
Jin 29 0


"""
name = Jin
age = 29
money = 0
"""

```

# if we want to take user input as items in a list
```
e = input("Say anything, and any word will be elements in a list (separated by space) : ").split()

print(e)
```
```
Say anything, and any word will be elements in a list (separated by space) : Do Re Mi
['Do', 'Re', 'Mi']
```

# if I want to take multiple integers at once
There are two ways to do this.


1. Using List comprehension
```
f = [int(x) for x in input("Enter multiple values : ").split()]
print(f)
```
This will result in
```
Enter multiple values : 55 22 33 44 111
[55, 22, 33, 44, 111]
```
2. Using map function
```
a,b,c = list(map(int, input("hello, enter multiple values : ").split()))
print(a,b,c)
```
This will result in 
```
hello, enter multiple values : 1 15 23
1 15 23
```
