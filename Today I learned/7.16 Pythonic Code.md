# 7/16 Today I learned...

- I am rewriting from what it says here

(Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python)
https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter6.html

### Though I didn't understand everything here, I have come to understand some of it.

```
(What I mean by 'understanding' here is I can implement the sayings in the book.

For example,

There is a aphorism that says `Special cases arenâ€™t special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.`.

I can understand the meaning of it in my head, 

but if I don't know what special cases should be used for practicality and when I decide certain cases aren't that special,

then I will take that as I did NOT understand.)
```
These things are the ones I understood.


## Readability counts
Write descriptive names for variables or functions.
```py
a = ["Nabi", 5, "Black"]
```
```py
my_cat_info = ["Nabi", 5, "Black"]
```
we can tell which name feels like easier to read.

## Use `enumerate()` , instead of `range(len())`
```py
my_stocks_list = ["AAPL","NFLX","GOOG"]
for index in range(len(my_stocks_list)):
    print(index, my_stocks_list[index])
```
```py
my_stocks_list = ["AAPL","NFLX","GOOG"]
for index, each_stock in enumerate(my_stocks_list):
    print(index, each_stock)
```
Although these two example has the same result
```
0 AAPL
1 NFLX
2 GOOG
```
It is preferable to use `enumerate()` instead of old `range(len())` convention. It is easy to understand `enumerate()`

## Use fstring instead of format string methods, or %s specifiers
```py
name = "Nabi".upper()
age = 5
print(f"hello my name is {name}, I am {age} years old.")
```

## For dictionary, use `get()` and `setdefault()`, instead of accessing values by `dictionary_name[key]`
### `get()`
```py
number_of_pets = {"cats":1}
number_of_dogs = number_of_pets.get("dogs",0)
number_of_cats = number_of_pets.get("cats",0)

print(f"I have {number_of_dogs} dogs.")
print(f"I have {number_of_cats} cats.")
```
```
I have 0 dogs.
I have 1 cats.
```
```py
number_of_pets = {"cats":1}
number_of_dogs = number_of_pets.get("dogs",0)
number_of_cats = number_of_pets.get("cats",0)

print(f"I have {number_of_pets['dogs']} dogs.")
print(f"I have {number_of_cats} cats.")
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\daily\Desktop\Coding\Python\git_practice\practice.py", line 5, in <module>
    print(f"I have {number_of_pets['dogs']} dogs.")
KeyError: 'dogs'
```
### `setdefault()`
<em>first example</em>
```py
introduce = "This is some random sentence. Guess how many spaces are in this sentence."
dic = {}
dic.setdefault("space_counts",introduce.count(" "))
print(dic)
```
```py
introduce = "This is some random sentence. Guess how many spaces are in this sentence."
dic2 = {}
count = 0
for each_char in introduce:
    if each_char == " ":
        count += 1
dic2["space_counts"] = count 
print(dic2)
```
