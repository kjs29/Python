# Refactoring codes

Let's take a look a this example

```py
def calculate(d):
    q = 3.14
    z = q * (d ** 2)
    print(z)
```

But it can't be read easily

so in order to help the reader understand the code more easily we can refactor this code snippet.

```py
def circle_area(radius):
    pi = 3.14
    area = pi * (radius ** 2)
    print(area)
```
