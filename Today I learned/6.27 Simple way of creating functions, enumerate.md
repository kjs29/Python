# Better way to create functions, enumerate 


Lets suppose that we are given an instruction to create a function.

The instruction is as below,

```
BlackJack

If we see a card that says "J", "Q", "K", return 10
if we see a card that says "A", return 1
if we see a card that is a number, return the number
```

What I came up with originally was like this

<details>
  <summary>my original code</summary>
  
  ```py
  
  def value_of_card(card):
      """Determine the scoring value of a card.

      :param card: str - given card.
      :return: int - value of a given card.  See below for values.

      1.  'J', 'Q', or 'K' (otherwise known as "face cards") = 10
      2.  'A' (ace card) = 1
      3.  '2' - '10' = numerical value.
      """
      if type(card) == str:
          if card.upper() == "J" or card.upper() == "Q" or card.upper() == "K":
              return 10
          elif card.upper() == "A":
              return 1
          else:
              print("Try again")
      elif type(card) == int:
          if 1 < card < 10:
              return card
          else:
              print("Try again")
  ```
</details>

but this can be written in like this simply
<details>
  <summary>simple code</summary>
  
  ```py
  def value_of_card(card):
    
      if type(card) == str:
          if card.upper() in "JQK":
              return 10
          elif card.upper() in "A":
              return 1

      else:
          return int(card)
  ```
  
</details>

we can see that the second one is a lot better.

And I am wondering what it takes to write codes like the second one from being able to write the first code.

# Enumerate

`enumerate` gives both index position and value
<em>example</em>
```py
stocks = ["AAPL","GRPO","WMT"]
for index_pos, value in enumerate(stocks):
    print(f"{index_pos} : {value}")
```
