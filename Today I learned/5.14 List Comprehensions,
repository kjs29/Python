1.
List comprehensions

2.
create a list
I can use either while or range() functions

---example of list comprehensions
"""
Syntax for list comprehensions
[<expression> for <element> in <collection>]
"""

stockprices = [124, 0.055, 25, 2350, 444000]

#we want 5% up on each stock price - list comprehension
today = [num * 1.05 for num in stockprices]

print(today)                      #[130.20000000000002, 0.05775, 26.25, 2467.5, 466200.0]

"""
Normally we would write like
today = []
for num in stockprices:
  num * 1.05
  num = today.append(num)
print(today)
