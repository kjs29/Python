### Tuples

Tuples are containers for one or multiple variables

Tuples are collections of values grouped together

<em>example of tuple</em>
```py
random_stock_info = ("AAPL", 105.5, 5, False)
```

`"AAPL"` is a string (ticker symbol)

`105.5` is float (stock price)

`5` is integer (number of shares to buy)

`False` is boolean (whether the program buys stocks right now)

### as we can see, tuples hold varieties of different datatypes

# Then what is the purpose of tuples?

## - The purpose of tuples is to pass around the collection of data as single object

Therefore we must be good at packing, and unpacking items in a tuple

<em>unpacking example</em>
```py
random_stock_info = ("AAPL", 105.5, 5, False)

#tuple unpacking
name, stock_price_of_apple, number_of_shares, if_buy = random_stock_info

print(name)
print(stock_price_of_apple)
print(number_of_shares)
print(if_buy)
```

<em>What we saw earlier is an example of packing tuple.</em>
```py
random_stock_info = ("AAPL", 105.5, 5, False)
```

## Tuples usually hold different datatypes and lists usually hold the same datatype
```py
random_stock_info = ("AAPL", 105.5, 5, False)
lst_stock_prices = [100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110]
```
