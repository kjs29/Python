# Asynchronicity

Programs usually executes from top to bottom.

If a python file looks like this

```py
def foo():
    # Do something foo

def bar():
    # Do something bar
```

The program will execute foo() first, and it waits til `foo()` is done.

And then `bar()` starts running.

```
Do something foo
Do something bar
```

However, Asynchronous programming is different. It allows us to execute functions at the same time.

```py

import asyncio

async def first_task():

    print("Task Starts")

    await asyncio.sleep(5)

    print("Task finishes")


async def main():

    print("Main Starts")

    task = asyncio.create_task(first_task())

    await asyncio.sleep(3)

    print("Main is running still")

    await task

    print("Main finishes")

asyncio.run(main())
```

```
Main Starts
Task Starts
Main is running still
Task finishes
Main finishes
```
