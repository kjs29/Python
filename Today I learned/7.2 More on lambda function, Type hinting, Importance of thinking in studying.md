# 7/2 Today I learned...

Type hinting, lamda(anonymous function), and I thought about how to study effectively

# Type hinting

I have seen things like this
```py
def is_pass(grade: int) -> int:
    return "Pass" if grade >= 50 else "Fail"
```
`grade: int` means that this function is hinting at us that it takes int type arguments,

`-> int` means that this will return integer as well

# Lambda function! (More complex lambda function - Multiple conditions)

On 7/1, we learned what lambda function is.

```
def grade_system(grade):
    return "Pass" if grade >= 50 else "Fail"

for grades in range(30, 101, 15):
    print(f"Grades : {grades}\n{grade_system(grades)}")
```
results in

```
Grades : 30 Fail
Grades : 45 Fail
Grades : 60 Pass
Grades : 75 Pass
Grades : 90 Pass
```

Now we have more complex lambda function
```py
grade_system = lambda grade: "Pass - A" if grade >= 90 else ("Pass - B" if 80 <= grade < 90 else("Pass - C" if 70 <= grade < 80 else("Pass - D" if 50 <= grade < 70 else "fail")))
for grade in range(30,101,15):
    print(f"Grade : {grade}\nResult: {grade_system(grade)}\n")
```
results in
```
Grade : 30 Result: fail
Grade : 45 Result: fail
Grade : 60 Result: Pass - D
Grade : 75 Result: Pass - C
Grade : 90 Result: Pass - A
```

*These two functions are the same
```py
grade_system = lambda grade: "Pass - A" if grade >= 90 else ("Pass - B" if 80 <= grade < 90 else("Pass - C" if 70 <= grade < 80 else("Pass - D" if 50 <= grade < 70 else "fail")))

def grade_systme(grade):
    if grade >= 90:
        return "Pass - A"
    elif 80 <= grade < 90:
        return "Pass - B"
    elif 70 <= grade < 80:
        return "Pass - C"
    elif 50 <= grade < 70:
        return "Pass - D"
    else:
        return "fail"
```

# Lastly I want to talk about how to study effectively, efficiently.

Studying effectively is all about `knowing what we know`, `knowing what we don't know`.

Right now, I am learning new concept like `lambda`. Therefore, understanding the definition of `lambda` is very important in `knowing what we know`.

<em>Example</em>

Definition of lambda:

Lambda helps create functions in one line, it is more simple.

In lambda functions, there is no `def`, there is no `(` or `)` in parameters, there is no `return`, and there is no linechange. 

With my current knowledge, I know that these two functions are doing exact same as these.

```py
def random_function1(x, y):
    return x + y

def random_function2(x, y):
    return x - y
```

```py
random_lambda_function1 = lambda x, y: x + y
random_lamda_function2 = lambda x, y: x - y
```

However, people use lambda functions like this.

```py

random_lst = [lambda x,y: x+y, lambda a,b:a-b]

print(random_lst[0](1,5))       #6
print(random_lst[1](5,5))       #0

```

My first reaction when I encounter new concepts like this is I get CONFUSED feelings.

But if I understand that this state is simply `Knowing what we don't know`, things start to look different.

I tell myself,

1. "I thought I knew lambda function, but it seeems like lambda function  can be used in a different way like this."
2. "What is this usage? lambda function is now used as an element in a list."
3. "Since lambda function is just like syntax for creating function in one line, I assume that some other functions can be used like an element in a list."
4. "Oh I realized that I have never used functions as an element in a list. I should learn that."
```
