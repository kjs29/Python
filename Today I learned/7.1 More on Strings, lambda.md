# Strings

## Two ways to iterate through a string

Strings are just like lists, except that they are immutable,

Strings can be accessed with index
```py
str1 = "hello"
print(str1[0])      #
print(str1[:-1])    #hell
```
### <em>First way to iterate string</em>
```py
str1 = "hello"
for each_letter in str1:
    print(each_letter)
```
<em>result</em>
```
h
e
l
l
o
```

### <em>Second way to iterate string</em>
```py
str2 = "world"
for index in range(len(str2)):
    print(str2[index])
```

<em>result</em>
```
w
o
r
l
d
```

# To find out how many 'love's are in the given sentence, use `.count()`

```py
a = "lovely love love lovey dovey".count("love")
print(a)                    #4
```

# Lambda function (Anonymous function)

<em>My First Lambda function!</em>
```py
add_two = lambda var1: var1 + 2
```
This is same as 
```py
def add_two(var1):
    return var1 + 2
```

# A bit more complex lambda function!(with if statement)

Create a lambda function that passes if grade is equal or over 50, fails if grade is less than 50

```py
grade_system = lambda grade: "Pass" if grade >= 50 else "fail"
```
