# Passing an arbitrary number of arguments

When we make functions, sometimes we don't know how many arguments we will have.

In this case, we put `*` in front of parameter when we define it.

```python
def pizza(*toppings):
    print("Pizza")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")
```

this means, we can now call this `pizza()` with one argument or 3 or more arguments.

```python
pizza("Pepperoni", "Cheese", "Sweet Potato")
pizza("Regular")
```

```py
Pizza
- Pepperoni
- Cheese
- Sweet Potato
Pizza
- Regular
```

`*toppings` means that it will create an empty tuple.

to find out,
```
def arbi_function(*args):
    print(args)

arbi_function("One book")
```
This will result

```
#Tuple
('One book',)
```

# Mixing
