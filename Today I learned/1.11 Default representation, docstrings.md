# Default representation

```py
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greeting(self):
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}")

person1 = Person("JS")

print(person1) # <__main__.Person object at 0x104818150>
```

When we use print function and get some random numbers and characters, we can figure that Python uses default representation which means it shows the position of the object store in a computer's memory.

Then how do we tell python program to print what we want?

We can use `__str__` method.

```py
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greeting(self):
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"This person's name is {self.name}"

person1 = Person("JS")

print(person1) # This person's name is JS
```
# Docstring

We can also add docstring, which helps people to understand our codes as well as it helps us to understand other people's codes.

```py
def some_complicating_function():
    """This is a very complicated function and this is the description of the function."""
    pass

print(help(some_complicating_function))
```

```
Help on function some_complicating_function in module __main__:

some_complicating_function()
    This is a very complicated function and this is the description of the function.
```

We can also add docstring to class, classs' methods.

```py
class Person:
    """This describes Person class"""

    def __init__(self):
        """This describes .__init__ method"""
        pass

    def greeting(self):
        """This describes .greeting method"""
        pass

print(help(Person()))
print(help(Person().__init__))
print(help(Person().greeting))
```

Result

```
