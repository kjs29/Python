# How to run Python file in Command Prompt

1. Turn command prompt
2. Type 'cd' for current location
3. Type 'dir' for current files
4. Type directory where current file is, which is `cd Desktop\Coding\Python'
5. When you are in the folder where the file you want to run is, then type 'python "array.py"
6. Done!

# Try / Except
If we have some dangerous code (preferably one line) that is likely to cause some error,

We can use try/except to avoid having an error

Basically it is like, try this(try) or try that (except)
```
try:
    print(var1)
except:
    print("var1 was not defined.")

```

# 'is'

We can use ```is``` as strong ```==```

The difference between ```is``` and ```==``` is,

```is``` checks if two variables are the same value and type

but ```==``` checks if two variables are the same value

For example,
```
print(0 is 0.0)
```
will lead to 
```False```
