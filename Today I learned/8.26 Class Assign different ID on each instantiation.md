When we create a class and instantiate objects, we sometimes want to assign unique number or identifier to each object.

For example, 

We have a class 
```py
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id
    
```

We instantiate 
```py
robot_1 = Robot("Do", 1)
```
and instantiate again
```py
robot_2 = Robot("Re", 2)
```
let's check each object's ids
```py
print(robot_1.id)
print(robot_2.id)
```
```
1
2
```
We can assign id number manually.

But we can also write like this so that whenever we create objects, an unique id number is assigned to an object

First, create a class and <strong>a class variables</strong> named id

and when we construct, we will increment 1 so when a new object is created, a new id will be assigned to that specific id is assigned
```py
class Robot:
    id = 0
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        Robot.id += 1
        self.id = Robot.id
```

```py
robot_1 = Robot("Do")
robot_2 = Robot("Re")
```
let's check each object's id
```py
print(robot_1.id)
print(robot_2.id)
```
<em>result</em>
```
1
2
```

The key to assign different id on each instantiation is 'having a class variable'.

And we can let that class variable increment by 1 every time the object is instantiated, we will have different ids like `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5` and so on.

```py
class Robot:
    
    # class variable 'id'
    id = 0
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        Robot.id += 1
        self.id = Robot.id
        
robot_1 = Robot("Do")   # first instantiation
print(robot_1.id)       # class variable id is 1

robot_2 = Robot("Re")   # second instantiation
print(robot_2.id)       # class variable id is 2

robot_3 = Robot("Re")   # second instantiation
print(robot_3.id)       # class variable id is 3
```
