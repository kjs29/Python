In pygame, we either press keys or mouse clicks to exit the game.

<em>click x button implementation</em>
```py
run = True
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
```
<em>press escape key once implementation</em>
```py
run = True
while run:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                run = False
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()
```
<em>click once implementation</em>
```py
run = True
clicked = False
while run:
    mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
    if randombutton1_rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos):
        if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] == 1 and clicked == False:
            clicked = True
            run = False
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
    
```
but if write things like this every time we want to exit, 

there will be an error message that like this

```
pygame.error: video system not initialized
```

In order to avoid this, we need to use `sys.exit()` just once after the game loop ends.

Every time we want the event to trigger the game to exit, we should use only game controls like `run = False`

if we use `pygame.quit()` as well, we will get the same error message.

So,

```py
clicked = False
run = True
game = False
while run:
    if game == False:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                run = False
            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                    run = False
    else:
        mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
        if randombutton1_rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos):
            if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] == 1 and clicked == False:
                clicked = True
                run = False

# at the end of the entire game loop, use sys.exit()
sys.exit()
```
