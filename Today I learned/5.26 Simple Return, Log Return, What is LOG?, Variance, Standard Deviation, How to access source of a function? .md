5/26 Today I learned...

1. Simple Return & Log Return

Simple Return - calculating multiple assets
- simple return = (ending price - starting price)/starting price

Logarithmic Return - calculating one single asset
- log return = log(ending price) - log(starting price) = log(ending price / starting price)

2. Variance - measure risks

3. Standard Deviation



4. Correlation Coefficient


5. How to access to sourcecode

```
import inspect
print(inspect.getsource(function_name))
```


What is LOG?

We have 5000 dollars, and we know this one strategy's annual return is 10%
How many years does it take for our initial 5000 to become 25000?

5000 * 1.1<sup>x</sup> = 25000

1.1<sup>x</sup> = 5

x = log<sub>1.1</sub>5

We read like
"x is equal to log of 5, base of 1.1"

if we want to create function in python
it would look like

```
import math

howmanyyears = math.log(5, 1.1) 
print(howmanyyears)       #16.886317030755073
```

The Difference between Simple Return and Log Return
Log Returns are additive over time.
Simple Returns are not addictive over time.

For example,
If we have initial capital of $5000,

If Simple Daily return is 1%, and in an year, the capital will be 5000 * 1.01<sup>252</sup> = $61370 (252 is # of trading days in an year) 

Annual return will be (61370 - 5000) / 5000 * 100 =  1,127% (11 times original capital)

If Log Daily return is 1%, and in an year, the capital will be 5000 + (0.01 * 252 * 5000) = 5000 + 12600 = $17600

Annual return will be 0.01 * 252 * 100 = 252% (2.52 times original capital)


Variance
```
#individual returns of strategy1
strategy1 = [3,2,4,-1,-2,-17,25]

def calculate_variance(strategy):
  mean = sum(strategy)/len(strategy)
  result = 0
  for a in strategy:
    b = (a - mean) ** 2
    result += b
  return result/len(strategy) 



c=calculate_variance(strategy1)
print(c)            #131.42857142857142
```

Standard Deviation
- In a normal distribution curve, the meaning of standard deviation is really important.
- Standard deviation is about how disperse each data are from their average data.
- What is more rare? between having IQ of 115, and having age of 115.
- Probably age of 115, it is because the standard deviation of age is smaller than IQ's.
- It also has meaningful probability , one standard deviation is 68%
```
import numpy as np
from math import sqrt   #we want to use the function sqrt()

strategy1 = [3,2,4,-1,-2,-17,25]


#function to calculate variance
def calculate_variance(strategy):
  mean = sum(strategy)/len(strategy)
  result = 0
  for a in strategy:
    b = (a - mean) ** 2
    result += b
  return result/len(strategy)

#function to calculate standard deviation
def calculate_stddev(strategy):
  return sqrt(calculate_variance(strategy))


print(calculate_stddev(strategy1))      #11.464230084422216

#test to see if we made our function correctly
test1 = np.std(strategy1)
print(test1)          #11.464230084422216
