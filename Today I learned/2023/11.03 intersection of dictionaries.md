I got ideas from [350. Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/description/)

Let's say that we have two dictionaries.

```py
a = {'a':1,'b':2}

b = {'a':0,'b':3}
```

What would be the value of `a|b`?

The anwer is 

```py
{'a':0,'b':3}
```

In dictionary, `|` operator takes the second dictionary.

Then can we have intersection of two dictionaries? 

Where a key exists in both dictionary, and value is the minimum value of two corresponding values.

```py
a = {'a':1,'b':2}
b = {'a':0,'b':3}
```

We want something like

```
{'a':0, 'b':2}
```

Can we try `&` operator?

```py
print(a & b)    # ?
```

Unfortunately, we can't use `&` operator on dictionaries. (In set, we can.)

We could write like the following.

```py
a = {'a':1,'b':2}
b = {'a':0,'b':3}

new = {}
for k,v in a.items():
    if k in b:
        new[k] = min(a[k],b[k])
print(new)          # {'a': 0, 'b': 2}
```

We can also import `Counter` from `collections`

```py
from collections import Counter
a = Counter({'a':1,'b':2})
b = Counter({'a':0,'b':3})
print(a & b)        # {'a': 0, 'b': 2}
```
