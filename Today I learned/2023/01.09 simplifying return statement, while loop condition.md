# Statement in return 

```py
def is_positive(num):
    if num > 0:
        return True
    else:
        return None
```

We can rewrite this again

```py
def is_positive(num):
    return True if num > 0 else None
```

```py
def is_positive(num):
    return num > 0 if num > 0 else None
```

How do we simplify this return statement?


```py
def is_even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0 :
        return True
    return False
```

# While loop

```py
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

After the while loop, there is one condition `x < 5 `.

If this condition becomes False, this while loop stops.

In other words, as long as the condition is True, it runs.

### Precedure

1.

When x = 0, it tests the condition, which is `True`,

```
print(x) # 0
x += 1 # x = 1 now
```

and then it goes back to the beginning of the while loop.

2.

Now that x = 1, while loop tries to see if the condition is met again, which is `True`, so 

```
print(x) # 1
x += 1 # x = 2 now
```

3.

x is 2 now, and the condition(`x < 5`) is `True`.

```
print(x) # 2
x += 1 # x = 3 now
```

4.

x is 3 now, and the condition('x < 5') is `True`.

```
print(x) # 3
x += 1 # x = 4 now
```

5.

x is 4 now, and the condition('x < 5') is `True`.

```
print(x) # 4
x += 1 # x = 5 now
```

6.

x is 5 now, and the condition(`x < 5`) is <strong>`False`</strong>, and it breaks out of while loop.

<em>output</em>

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### while loop conditions

```py
x = int(input())
while x < 10 and x % 2 == 0:
    print("hello")
```

This means that this while loop only executes if x < 10 and x is even number.

# Formatting

```py
a = "hello"
b = len(a)

print("{} {}".format(a,b))
```

is the same as

```py
a = "hello"
b = len(a)

print(f"{a} {b}")
```


Also

```py
a = 1.42313

print("{:.2f}".format(a)) # 1.42

print(f"{a:.2f}") # 1.42
```
