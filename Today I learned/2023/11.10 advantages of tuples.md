I have got some insight from [49. Group Anagrams - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)

My first solution was something really slow - `O(n^2*k) when n is the length of nums, and k is the length of each word`

My initial solution

```py
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        
        group_fr = []
        for each in strs:               # n
            tmp = {}
            for ch in each:             # k
                if ch not in tmp:
                    tmp[ch] = 1
                else:
                    tmp[ch] += 1
            if tmp not in group_fr:     # worst case = n * k
                group_fr.append(tmp)
        
        # so far, time complexity is already n(k+(n*k)), which simplifies to n^2*k

        # print(group_fr)  # [{'e': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}, {'t': 1, 'a': 1, 'n': 1}, {'b': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}]
        
        ans = []
        for _ in range(len(group_fr)):
            ans.append([])
        
        for each in strs:
            tmp = {}
            for ch in each:
                if ch not in tmp:
                    tmp[ch] = 1
                else:
                    tmp[ch] += 1
            for i in range(len(group_fr)):
                if tmp == group_fr[i]:
                    ans[i].append(each)
        return ans
```

Then I found some solutions online, and many people came up with `sorted()`, idea behind this is that if each word is anagram, the sorted version of each word are the same.

For example,

`bca` and `abc` are anagrams, because the sorted versions are `abc` and `abc`, which are the same.

***Solution (using sorted string as keys in the dictionary)***

```py
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagram_map = dict()
        
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
            if sorted_word in anagram_map:
                anagram_map[sorted_word].append(word)
            else:
                anagram_map[sorted_word] = [word]

        return anagram_map.values()
```

But there is one more efficient solution that is usig tuple as keys in the dictionary.

***Solution using tuple***

```py

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagram_map = dict()
        
        for word in strs:
            # Count the frequency of each character in the word
            char_count = [0] * 26  # [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
            for ch in word:
                char_count[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1 
            
            if tuple(char_count) not in anagram_map:
                anagram_map[tuple(char_count)] = [word]
            else:    
                anagram_map[tuple(char_count)].append(word)
        
        """
        strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

        anagram_map = {
            (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0): ['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], 
            (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0): ['tan', 'nat'], 
            (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0): ['bat']
        }
        """

        return anagram_map.values()
```

This solution used frequency of each letter in the list, using unicode converter built-in method. `ord()`

Unicodes are used in ASCII table.

```py
ord('c')    # 99, 'c' is converted to unicode
ord('b')    # 98
ord('a')    # 97

ord('c') - ord('a') # 2
ord('b') - ord('a') # 1
```

Then the completed list is converted to tuple that's used as key in the dictionary.

The reason why this solution is faster than the previous solution is that tuples are hashables and are ideal when being used as keys.

Some other useful ways to utilize tuples are the following

### 1. Iteration

```py
for i in (1,2,3,4,5):       # faster than list
    # process
```

### 2. packing and unpacking

```py
def xy_coordinate():
    return x, y
```

We need to keey in mind that tuple's efficiency is not just limited to dictionary keys but also other scenarios.
