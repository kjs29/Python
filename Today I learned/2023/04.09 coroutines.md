# What is Coroutines?

Coroutines refer to asynchronous functions

Coroutine are declared with async/await syntax

Coroutine functions return coroutine objects when called

```py
import asyncio

async def send_email():
    print("hello")
```

We made coroutine `send_email()`, but in order to call this coroutine object, we need to write

```py
asyncio.run(send_email())
```

We can verifiy whether it is a coroutine function by 

```py
print(asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(send_email()))
```

# asyncio can also reorder the tasks

```py
import asyncio

async def task_1():
    await task_2()
    print("Task 1")

async def task_2():
    await task_3()
    print("Task 2")

async def task_3():
    print("Task 3")

asyncio.run(task_1())
```

```
Task 3
Task 2
Task 1
```
