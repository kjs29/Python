Let's take a look at the example code below.

```py
a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'

print(a)    # 'banana'
print(b)    # 'banana'

c = [1,2,3]
d = [1,2,3]

print(c)    # [1,2,3]
print(d)    # [1,2,3]
```

The variables `a` and `b` both print 'banana',

and `c` and `d` both print `[1,2,3]`.

To test if `a` and `b` hold the same value, we can use type,

```py
print(a == b)     # True
```

Same with `c` and `d`.

```py
print(c == d)     # True
```

But if we type

```py
print(a is b)     # True
print(c is d)     # False
```

We can see that `a is b` is True, but `c is d` is False.

This means that `a` and `b` have the same content, and they appoint to the same memory address.

Just like the picture below.

But `c` and `d` have the same content but they appoint to the different memory address.

### `a` and `b` are equivalent (have same value) and identical(share the same memory address).

```py
a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'

print(a is b)     # True, a and b are equivalent
                  # When two variables are equivalent, they are automatically identical 
```

### `c` and `d` are equivalent (have same value) but not identical(share the different memory addresses).

```py
c = [1,2,3]
d = [1,2,3]

print(c == d)     # True, c and d are equivalent
print(c is d)     # False, c and d are NOT identical
```

If we want `c` and `d` to be identical, we can try like this.

```py
c = [1,2,3]
d = c

print(c is d)     # True
```

# When an object is aliased

We know that `[1,2,3]` is an object.

`c` is a variable and association of a variable with an object is called a `reference`.

When there are multiple reference to one object, we call that the object is `aliased`.

When aliased object is mutable like lists, changes made to the object affect all the variables that appoint the object's memory address.

For example,

```py
c = [1,2,3]
d = c     # [1,2,3]

print(c is d)     # True

c.append(4)

print(d)    #[1,2,3,4]
```

We changed `c` but `d` is affected since `d` has the same reference as `c`.
